# perfect-readme-generator

## Description

I created a readme generator that uses nodejs to take in user inputs and write a readme file. It requires a license to be chosen and it fills in basic readme content as well as generating the table of contents with working links to that section of the readme.

## Table of Contents

* [Description](#description)
* [Installation](#installation)
